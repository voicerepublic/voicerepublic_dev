        All content on Voice Republic is free to listen to. Content producers pay per Talk, and Talk Credits can be purchased in packages. A Talk Credit will never expire.

      pricing-feature-1: One Talk Credit = One Talk
      pricing-description-1:  One Talk Credit allows one Talk to be broadcast, uploaded and archived. There is no limit to the number of times the Talk can be heard, downloaded or embedded.
      pricing-feature-2: Credits Last Forever
      pricing-description-2:  Any Credits you purchase will be fully valid for as long as your Voice Republic account exists.
      pricing-feature-3: No Recurring Costs
      pricing-description-3: Only purchase Talk Credits when you need them. No subscription necessary.
      pricing-footnote: |
        &#42;A Credit does not, however, cover the cost of the Voice Republic “Ground Crew” operating a stage at your event. For “Ground Crew” services, please refer to the Ground Crew Pricing Guide.
