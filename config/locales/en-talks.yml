      tags_hint: |
        Tags are keywords for related topics. They improve the discoverability of your talks in the Voice Republic archive and in search engines like Google.<br><br>
        With your tags you define the category your talk is listed. The following categories can be added: <br><br>
        <ul>
        <li>Business</li>
        <li>Arts & Culture</li>
        <li>Politics & Society</li>
        <li>Sciences</li>
        <li>Technology</li>
        <li>Media</li>
        </ul>  
        Your tags should also include information on the speakers and on the topic and format of the talk. We suggest more frequently used keywords that will help with orientation.
        Use commas to separate the tags. 
      thing_hint: |
