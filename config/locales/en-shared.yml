      headline: What Is Voice Republic?
      text: |
        Voice Republic is the platform for the spoken word. 
        Listen to thousands of high quality audio podcasts 
        from the fields of politics, science, arts and culture, 
        technology and business. We offer free live streaming, 
        archiving and free podcast hosting to conferences, 
        cultural and political institutions and podcasters. 
        Use our easy-to-handle technology to reach an interested 
        and engaged audience with your lecture, panel, reading or 
        presentation. Either upload your audio files directly to our 
        archive or stream your event live. After a live broadcast, 
        the talk will automatically be saved in the audio archive and 
        can be heard at any time or downloaded as a podcast.
