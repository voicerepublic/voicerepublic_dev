          With your personal account you can now download all talks in
          the Voice Republic archive as podcasts and listen to them
          wherever and whenever you want to. You can also take part in
          the discussions during live talks.


          Of course, you can also start your own live stream or easily
          upload your audio files. Before a live talk, we recommend
          you conduct a test talk. You will find useful tips on how to
          use Voice Republic in our help section. If you have any
          further questions, please contact us directly under
          service@voicerepublic.com.

        Unfortunately, at this stage, we do not have the manpower to
        support every browser. We rather strive to to build the most
        awesome user experience using modern browsers. For a good
        experience with Voice Republic, please upgrade to the newest
        version or download one of the browsers below:

        * **Safari 7** (If you are on OSX < 10.9, you need to upgrade to
          get a newer version of Safari. It is easier to use Chrome or
          Firefox.)

        * [Download Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie)
