        You’re about to create a test talk.


        Test talks have all the same features as regular talks, but
        they will only be saved on your profile for 24 hours. After
        that the talk will automatically be deleted.


        Happy testing!

      text: >-

        Voice Republic is the platform for the spoken word. We offer
        you a simple tool to stream your event, your presentation,
        your discussion or lecture live or make it accessible for
        everyone by uploading it to the audio archive. The live stream
        gives listeners who can not personally be at an event or live
        performance the opportunity to listenin and to get involved –
        using the comment function, they can actively take part in the
        discussion. After the live broadcast, the talk will
        automatically be saved in our [audio archive](/explore) and
        can be heard at any time or downloaded as a podcast. You can
        also easily upload existing recordings. Starting at [12 euros
        per talk](/pricing) you can boost your reach and position your
        content from the fields of politics,science, arts and culture,
        technology and business in a guaranteed high-quality
        environment. Listening to the live streams and downloading the
        podcasts is free for all users.
