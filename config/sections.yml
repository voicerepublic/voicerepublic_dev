          With your personal account you can now download all talks in
          the Voice Republic archive as podcasts and listen to them
          wherever and whenever you want to. You can also take part in

        Are you organizing a conference, discussion panel, or
        holding lectures and workshops yourself? With Voice Republic
        you can publish your content to the whole world and reach a
        large audience.


        Broadcasting your own live stream is easy with Voice Republic's
        browser-based technology. You configure a talk
        in your Voice Republic account and simply click
        "Start" and "Stop" during the event. The technology you need on site is only
        a computer with internet access and an audio source. The
        comment feature gives you the opportunity to interact with
        your online audience. Listeners can comment and ask questions
        in real time. 


        After your event, your audio content is
        in good hands with us. All Talks are stored on the Voice
        Republic servers and are searchable in the archive immediately
        after the live broadcast.

        Already have existing
        recordings? You can also use our audio archive. Just upload
        your audio files and add your own photos, descriptive texts
        and—if you want to—presentation slides. Everyone can now
        listen to your content online or download it as a podcast. You
        can easily embed the Voice Republic Player into your own web
        page and share the Talks on social networks.
