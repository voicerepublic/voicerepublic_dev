          For a professional Talk, you need 6 things:
          / accordion

            %dd.accordion-navigation.has-dropdown
              %a{:href => "#panel1b"}
                = image_tag "support/laptop.svg"
                1. Computer
                %span.right
              #panel1b.content
                Either a Laptop or a Desktop computer, running a current version of
                %a{:href => "https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/", :target => "_blank"} Chrome
                or

                = image_tag "support/network.svg"
                2. Internet
                %span.right
              #panel2b.content
                A stable connection is needed throughout the Talk. Preferably a LAN connection with at least 50KB (kilobits per second) upload.
            %dd.accordion-navigation
              %a{:href => "#panel3b"}
                = image_tag "support/mic.svg"
                3. Audio Source
                %span.right
              #panel3b.content
                An external microphone connected to a mixer and an audio interface is highly recommended for optimal sound quality. For more information about the audio setup, refer to
                %a{:href => "#configure"} Step 1
                (below).  
            %dd.accordion-navigation
              %a{:href => "#panel4b"}
                = image_tag "support/headphone.svg"
                4. Headphones
                %span.light
                  (Strongly Recommended)
                %span.right
              #panel4b.content
                Needed in order to check the sound quality of the stream.    
            %dd.accordion-navigation
              %a{:href => "#panel5b"}
                = image_tag "support/user.svg"
                5. Stream Operator
                %span.light
                  (Strongly Recommended)
                %span.right
              #panel5b.content
                When the speaker is not near the computer, an additional person is recommended to start and end the Talk.       
            %dd.accordion-navigation
              %a{:href => "#panel6b"}
                = image_tag "support/recording.svg"
                6. Backup Recording
                %span.light
                  (Strongly Recommended)
                %span.right
              #panel6b.content
                Use an additional application (i.e. Audacity) to make a live recording of the Talk which you can upload later should something go wrong with the stream.
