       unicorn 4.8.0 - big internal changes, but compatible
       
       This release contains fairly major internal workings of master-to-worker
       notifications.  The master process no longer sends signals to workers
       for most tasks.  This works around some compatibility issues with some
       versions of the "pg" gem (and potentially any other code which may not
       handle EINTR properly).  One extra benefit is it also helps stray
       workers notice a rare, unexpected master death more easily.  Workers
       continue to (and will always) accept existing signals for compatibility
       with tools/scripts which may signal workers.
       
       PID file are always written early (even on upgrade) again to avoid
       breaking strange monitoring setups which use PID files.  Keep in mind we
       have always discouraged monitoring based on PID files as they are
       fragile.
       
       We now avoid bubbling IOError to the Rack app on premature client
       disconnects when streaming the input body.  This is usually not a
       problem with nginx, but may be on some LAN setups without nginx).
       
       Thanks to Sam Saffron, Jimmy Soho, Rodrigo Rosenfeld Rosas,
       Michael Fischer, and Andrew Hobson for their help with this release.
       
       Note: the unicorn mailing list will be moved/changed soon due to the
       RubyForge shutdown.  unicorn will always rely only on Free Software.
       There will never be any sign-up requirements nor terms-of-service to
       agree to when communicating with us.

       GNUmakefile: add "check" target for running all tests
       
       "check" rolls off the fingers of users familiar with GNU Automake
       more easily.  The "test-all" target is preserved for compatibility.

   commit 6f6e4115b4bb03e5e7c55def91527799190566f2
   Author: Eric Wong <e@80x24.org>
   Date:   Mon Dec 9 09:20:39 2013 +0000
   
       rework master-to-worker signaling to use a pipe
       
       Signaling using normal kill(2) is preserved, but the master now
       prefers to signal workers using a pipe rather than kill(2).
       Non-graceful signals (:TERM/:KILL) are still sent using kill(2),
       as they ask for immediate shutdown.
       
       This change is necessary to avoid triggering the ubf (unblocking
       function) for rb_thread_call_without_gvl (and similar) functions
       extensions.  Most notably, this fixes compatibility with newer
       versions of the 'pg' gem which will cancel a running DB query if
       signaled[1].
       
       This also has the nice side-effect of allowing a premature
       master death (assuming preload_app didn't cause the master to
       spawn off rogue child daemons).
       
       Note: users should also refrain from using "killall" if using the
       'pg' gem or something like it.
       
       Unfortunately, this increases FD usage in the master as the writable
       end of the pipe is preserved in the master.  This limit the number
       of worker processes the master may run to the open file limit of the
       master process.  Increasing the open file limit of the master
       process may be needed.  However, the FD use on the workers is
       reduced by one as the internal self-pipe is no longer used.  Thus,
       overall pipe allocation for the kernel remains unchanged.
       
       [1] - pg is correct to cancel a query, as it cannot know if
             the signal was for a) graceful unicorn shutdown or
             b) oh-noes-I-started-a-bad-query-ABORT-ABORT-ABORT!!

       doc: clarify SIGNALS and reference init example
       
       "interactive terminal" needed clarification.
       
       While we're at it, link to the init.sh example since it may
       be shared with nginx.

       always write PID file early for compatibility
       
       This reduces the window for a non-existent PID for folks who monitor
       PIDs (not a great idea anyways).  Unfortunately, this change also brings
       us back to the case where having a PID later (for other process monitors)
       is beneficial but more unicorn releases exist where we write the PID
       early.
       
       Thanks to Jimmy Soho for reporting this issue.

       stream_input: avoid IO#close on client disconnect
       
       This can avoid IOError from being seen by the application, and also
       reduces points where IO#close may be called.  This is a good thing
       if we eventually port this code into a low-level server like
       cmogstored where per-client memory space is defined by FD number of
       a client.

       tests: fix SO_REUSEPORT tests for old Linux and non-Linux
       
       On BSD-derived platforms the getsockopt true value may be any
       (>= 0) value, not just one as it is on Linux.
       
       Additionally, SO_REUSEPORT is only supported since Linux 3.9, so
       folks on older kernels may not have it available.  We still define it
       for Linux since kernel upgrades are usually more common than glibc
       upgrades.
       
       Note: we will still raise an exception at runtime if a user
       explicitly requests :reuseport in their config and runs an
       older Linux kernel.

       unicorn 4.7.0 - minor updates, license tweak
       
       * support SO_REUSEPORT on new listeners (:reuseport)
       
         This allows users to start an independent instance of unicorn on
         a the same port as a running unicorn (as long as both instances
         use :reuseport).
       
         ref: https://lwn.net/Articles/542629/
       
       * unicorn is now GPLv2-or-later and Ruby 1.8-licensed
         (instead of GPLv2-only, GPLv3-only, and Ruby 1.8-licensed)
       
         This changes nothing at the moment.  Once the FSF publishes the next
         version of the GPL, users may choose the newer GPL version without the
         unicorn BDFL approving it.  Two years ago when I got permission to add
         GPLv3 to the license options, I also got permission from all past
         contributors to approve future versions of the GPL.  So now I'm
         approving all future versions of the GPL for use with unicorn.
       
         Reasoning below:
       
         In case the GPLv4 arrives and I am not alive to approve/review it,
         the lesser of evils is have give blanket approval of all future GPL
         versions (as published by the FSF).  The worse evil is to be stuck
         with a license which cannot guarantee the Free-ness of this project
         in the future.
       
         This unfortunately means the FSF can theoretically come out with
         license terms I do not agree with, but the GPLv2 and GPLv3 will
         always be an option to all users.
       
         Note: we currently prefer GPLv3
       
       Two improvements thanks to Ernest W. Durbin III:
       
       * USR2 redirects fixed for Ruby 1.8.6 (broken since 4.1.0)
       * unicorn(1) and unicorn_rails(1) enforces valid integer for -p/--port
       
       A few more odd, minor tweaks and fixes:
       
       * attempt to rename PID file when possible (on USR2)
       * workaround reopen atomicity issues for stdio vs non-stdio
       * improve handling of client-triggerable socket errors

       bin/*: enforce -p/--port argument to be a valid integer
       
       Users may confuse '-p' with the (to-be-deprecated) '-P/--pid'
       option, leading to surprising behavior if a pathname is passed as a
       port, because String#to_i would convert it to zero, causing:
       
           TCPServer.new(host, port = 0)
       
       to bind to a random, unused port.

       attempt to rename PID file when possible
       
       This will preserve mtime on successful renames for comparisions.
       While we're at it, avoid writing the new PID until the listeners are
       inherited successfully.  This can be useful to avoid accidentally
       clobbering a good PID if binding the listener or building the app
       (preload_app==true) fails

       http_server: improve handling of client-triggerable socket errors
       
       We do not attempt to write HTTP responses for socket errors if
       clients disconnect from us unexpectedly.
       
       Additionally, we do not hide backtraces EINVAL/EBADF errors, since
       they are indicative of real bugs which must be fixed.
       
       We do continue to hide hide EOF, ECONNRESET, ENOTCONN, and EPIPE
       because clients (even "friendly") ones will break connections due to
       client crashes or network failure (which is common for me :P), and
       the backtraces from those will cause excessive logging and even
       become a DoS vector.

       Make -N/--no-default-middleware option work
       
       This fixes the -N (a.k.a. --no-defaut-middleware) option, which
       was not working.  The problem was that Unicorn::Configurator::RACKUP
       is cleared before the lambda returned by Unicorn.builder is run,
       which means that checking whether the :no_default_middleware option
       was set from the lambda could not detect anything.  This patch copies
       it to a local variable that won't get clobbered, restoring the feature.

       doc: update documentation for systemd + PrivateTmp users
       
       The PrivateTmp feature of systemd breaks the usage of /tmp for the
       shared Unix domain socket between nginx and unicorn, so discourage the
       use of /tmp in that case.
       
       While we're at it, use consistent paths for everything and use an
       obviously intended-for-user-customization "/path/to" prefix instead
       of "/tmp"

       unicorn 4.6.2 - HTTP parser fix for Rainbows!
       
       This release fixes a bug in Unicorn::HttpParser#filter_body
       which affected some configurations of Rainbows!  There is
       also a minor size reduction in the DSO.

       http: avoid frozen string bug in filter_body
       
       Our rb_str_modify() became no-ops due to incomplete reverts
       of workarounds for old Rubinius, causing rb_str_set_len to
       fail with: can't set length of shared string (RuntimeError)
       
       This bug was introduced due to improper workarounds for old
       versions of Rubinius in 2009 and 2010:

       "date +%s" is not in POSIX (it is in GNU, and at least FreeBSD

       sufficiently portable between different Ruby versions.

       older curl where -N did not work as advertised (but --no-buffer
       did).
       
       N.B. we don't use tee in unicorn tests, this just matches

   Author: Lin Jen-Shin <godfat@godfat.org>

       Add -N or --no-default-middleware option.
       
       This would prevent Unicorn from adding default middleware,
       as if RACK_ENV were always none. (not development nor deployment)
       
       This should also be applied to `rainbows' and `zbatery' as well.
       
       One of the reasons to add this is to avoid conflicting
       RAILS_ENV and RACK_ENV. It would be helpful in the case
       where a Rails application and Rack application are composed
       together, while we want Rails app runs under development
       and Rack app runs under none (if we don't want those default
       middleware), and we don't really want to make RAILS_ENV
       set to development and RACK_ENV to none because it might be
       confusing. Note that Rails would also look into RACK_ENV.
       
       Another reason for this is that only `rackup' would be
       inserting those default middleware. Both `thin' and `puma'
       would not do this, nor does Rack::Handler.get.run which is
       used in Sinatra.
       
       So using this option would make it work differently from
       `rackup' but somehow more similar to `thin' or `puma'.

       unicorn 4.5.0 - check_client_connection option
       
       The new check_client_connection option allows unicorn to detect
       most disconnected local clients before potentially expensive
       application processing begins.
       
       This feature is useful for applications experiencing spikes of
       traffic leading to undesirable queue times, as clients will
       disconnect (and perhaps even retry, compounding the problem)
       before unicorn can even start processing the request.
       
       To enable this feature, add the following line to a unicorn
       config file:
       
             check_client_connection true
       
       This feature only works when nginx (or any other HTTP/1.0+
       client) is on the same machine as unicorn.
       
       A huge thanks to Tom Burns for implementing and testing this
       change in production with real traffic (including mitigating
       an unexpected DoS attack).

       README: clarify license and copyright
       
       Since Ruby 1.9.3, (Matz) Ruby is licensed under a 2-clause BSDL.
       Thus we need to clarify we inherited the license terms from
       Ruby 1.8 to prevent misunderstanding.
       
       (The Ruby license change cannot alter the license of other
        projects automatically)
       
       Since we added the GPLv3 as an additional license in 2011,
       the license terms of unicorn no longer matches Mongrel 1.1.5.
       
       This is NOT a change to the unicorn license at all, just a
       wording clarification.

       fix const error responses for Rainbows!
       
       Rainbows! relies on the ERROR_XXX_RESPONSE constants of unicorn
       4.x.  Changing the constants in unicorn 4.x will break existing
       versions of Rainbows!, so remove the dependency on the constants
       and generate the error response dynamically.
       
       Unlike Mongrel, unicorn is unlikely to see malicious traffic and
       thus unlikely to benefit from making error messages constant.
       
       For unicorn 5.x, we will drop these constants entirely.
       
       (Rainbows! most likely cannot support check_client_connection
        consistently across all concurrency models since some of them
        pessimistically buffer all writes in userspace.  However, the
        extra concurrency of Rainbows! makes it less likely to be
        overloaded than unicorn, so this feature is likely less useful
        for Rainbows!)

       check_client_connection: document local-only requirement
       
       In my testing, only dropped clients over Unix domain sockets or
       loopback TCP were detected with this option.  Since many
       nginx+unicorn combinations run on the same host, this is not a
       problem.
       
       Furthermore, tcp_nodelay:true appears to work over loopback,
       so remove the requirement for tcp_nodelay:false.

       Begin writing HTTP request headers early to detect disconnected clients
       
       This patch checks incoming connections and avoids calling the application
       if the connection has been closed.
       
       It works by sending the beginning of the HTTP response before calling
       the application to see if the socket can successfully be written to.
       
       By enabling this feature users can avoid wasting application rendering
       time only to find the connection is closed when attempting to write, and
       throwing out the result.
       
       When a client disconnects while being queued or processed, Nginx will log
       HTTP response 499 but the application will log a 200.
       
       Enabling this feature will minimize the time window during which the problem
       can arise.
       
       The feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by adding
       'check_client_connection true' to the unicorn config.

         increased response time over the weekend.
       
         Whereas in previous flash traffic scenarios we would see the number of
         HTTP 499 responses grow past the number of real HTTP 200 responses,
         over the weekend we saw no growth in 499s during flash sales.

         attackers were disconnecting immediately after making a request.

       tests: remove assert_nothing_raised (part 2)
       
       assert_nothing_raised ends up hiding errors and backtraces,
       making things harder to debug.  Since Test::Unit already
       fails on uncaught exceptions, there is no need to assert
       on the lack of exceptions for a successful test run.

       unicorn 4.4.0 - minor updates
       
       Non-regular files are no longer reopened on SIGUSR1.  This
       allows users to specify FIFOs as log destinations.
       
       TCP_NOPUSH/TCP_CORK is no longer set/unset by default.  Use
       :tcp_nopush explicitly with the "listen" directive if you wish
       to enable TCP_NOPUSH/TCP_CORK.
       
       Listen sockets are now bound _after_ loading the application for
       preload_app(true) users.  This prevents load balancers from
       sending traffic to an application server while the application
       is still loading.
       
       There are also minor test suite cleanups.

       do not touch TCP_NOPUSH/TCP_CORK at all by default
       
       On a certain FreeBSD 8.1 installation, explicitly setting
       TCP_NOPUSH to zero (off) can cause EADDRNOTAVAIL errors and also
       resets the listen backlog to 5.  Enabling TCP_NOPUSH explicitly
       did not exhibit this issue for the user who (privately) reported
       this issue.
       
       To be on the safe side, we won't set/unset TCP_NOPUSH/TCP_CORK
       at all, which will leave it off on all current systems.

       bind listeners after loading for preload_app users
       
       In the case where preload_app is true, delay binding new
       listeners until after loading the application.
       
       Some applications have very long load times (especially Rails
       apps with Ruby 1.9.2).  Binding listeners early may cause a load
       balancer to incorrectly believe the unicorn workers are ready to
       serve traffic even while the app is being loaded.
       
       Once a listener is bound, connect() requests from the load
       balancer succeed until the listen backlog is filled.  This
       allows requests to pile up for a bit (depending on backlog size)
       before getting rejected by the kernel.  By the time the
       application is loaded and ready-to-run, requests in the
       listen backlog are likely stale and not useful to process.
       
       Processes inheriting listeners do not suffer this effect, as the
       old process should still be capable of serving new requests.
       
       This change does not improve the situation for the
       preload_app=false (default) use case.  There may not be a
       solution for preload_app=false users using large applications.
       
       Fortunately Ruby 1.9.3+ improves load times of large
       applications significantly over 1.9.2 so this should be less of
       a problem in the future.

       * PATH_INFO (aka REQUEST_PATH) increased to 4096 (from 1024).

         the system PATH_MAX value common to GNU/Linux systems for
         serving filesystem components with long names.
       
       * Apps that fork() (but do not exec()) internally for background
         tasks now indicate the end-of-request immediately after
         writing the Rack response.

       limit for PATH_MAX on modern GNU/Linux systems and REQUEST_PATH

       shutdown client socket for apps which fork in background
       
       Previously we relied on implicit socket shutdown() from the
       close() syscall.  However, some Rack applications fork()
       (without calling exec()), creating a potentially long-lived
       reference to the underlying socket in a child process.  This
       ends up causing nginx to wait on the socket shutdown when the
       child process exits.
       
       Calling shutdown() explicitly signals nginx (or whatever client)
       that the unicorn worker is done with the socket, regardless of
       the number of FD references to the underlying socket in
       existence.
       
       This was not an issue for applications which exec() since
       FD_CLOEXEC is always set on the client socket.
       
       Thanks to Patrick Wenger for discovering this.  Thanks to
       Hongli Lai for the tip on using shutdown() as is done in
       Passenger.

       Start the server if another user has a PID matching our stale pidfile.
       
       If unicorn doesn't get terminated cleanly (for example if the machine
       has its power interrupted) and the pid in the pidfile gets used by
       another process, the current unicorn code will exit and not start a
       server. This tiny patch fixes that behaviour.

       unicorn 4.2.0
       
       The GPLv3 is now an option to the Unicorn license.  The existing GPLv2
       and Ruby-only terms will always remain options, but the GPLv3 is
       preferred.
       
       Daemonization is correctly detected on all terminals for development
       use (Brian P O'Rourke).
       
       Unicorn::OobGC respects applications that disable GC entirely
       during application dispatch (Yuichi Tateno).
       
       Many test fixes for OpenBSD, which may help other *BSDs, too.
       (Jeremy Evans).
       
       There is now _optional_ SSL support (via the "kgio-monkey"
       RubyGem).  On fast, secure LANs, SSL is only intended for
       detecting data corruption that weak TCP checksums cannot detect.
       Our SSL support is remains unaudited by security experts.
       
       There are also some minor bugfixes and documentation
       improvements.
       
       Ruby 2.0.0dev also has a copy-on-write friendly GC which can save memory
       when combined with "preload_app true", so if you're in the mood, start
       testing Unicorn with the latest Ruby!

       quiet possible IOError from SIGUSR1 (reopen logs)
       
       It's possible for a SIGUSR1 signal to be received in the
       worker immediately before calling IO.select.  In that case,
       do not clutter logging with IOError and just process the
       reopen log request.

       socket_helper: set SO_KEEPALIVE on TCP sockets
       
       Even LANs can break or be unreliable sometimes and socket
       disconnect messages get lost, which means we fall back to
       the global (kill -9) timeout in Unicorn.
       
       While the default global timeout is much shorter (60s) than
       typical TCP timeouts, some HTTP application dispatches take much
       I/O or computational time (streaming many gigabytes), so the
       global timeout becomes ineffective.
       
       Under Linux, sysadmins are encouraged to lower the default
       net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_* knobs in sysctl.  There should be
       similar knobs in other operating systems (the default keepalive
       intervals are usually ridiculously high, too high for anything).
       
       When the listen socket has SO_KEEPALIVE set, the flag should be
       inherited by accept()-ed sockets.

       configurator: limit timeout to 30 days
       
       There's no practical difference between a timeout of 30 days and
       68 years from an HTTP server standpoint.
       
       POSIX limits us to 31 days, actually, but there could be
       rounding error with floats used in Ruby time calculations and
       there's no real difference between 30 and 31 days, either...
       
       Thanks to Jeremy Evans for pointing out large values will throw
       EINVAL (on select(2) under OpenBSD with Ruby 1.9.3 and

       The last-resort timeout mechanism was inaccurate and often

       Rack::Chunked and ContentLength middlewares by default
       
       This is needed to match the behavior of Rack::Server for
       RACK_ENV=(deployment|development), actually.  This won't
       affect users of other RACK_ENV values.
       
       This change has minor performance consequences, so users
       negatively affected should set RACK_ENV to "none" instead for
       full control of their middleware stack.
       
       This mainly affects Rainbows!/Zbatery users since they have
       persistent connections and /need/ Content-Length or
       Transfer-Encoding:chunked headers.

       future-proof against close-on-exec by default
       
       Setting the close-on-exec flag by default and closing
       non-standard descriptors is proposed for Ruby 1.9.4/2.0.0.
       Since Unicorn is one of the few apps to rely on FD inheritance
       across exec(), we need to workaround this by redirecting each
       listener FD to itself for Kernel#exec.
       
       Ruby supports a hash as the final argument to Kernel#exec since
       at least 1.9.1 (nobody cares for 1.9.0 anymore). This allows
       users to backport close-on-exec by default patches to older
       1.9.x installs without breaking anything.

       unicorn 4.0.1 - regression bugfixes
       
       This release fixes things for users of per-worker "listen"
       directives in the after_fork hook.  Thanks to ghazel@gmail.com
       for reporting the bug.
       
       The "timeout" configurator directive is now truncated to
       0x7ffffffe seconds to prevent overflow when calling
       IO.select.

       configurator: limit timeout to 32-bit INT_MAX-1
       
       Nobody will miss one second if they specify an "infinite"
       timeout of ~68 years.  This prevents duplicating this logic
       in Rainbows!

       longer than 68 years to respond :(

       unicorn 4.0.0 - for mythical hardware!
       
       A single Unicorn instance may manage more than 1024 workers
       without needing privileges to modify resource limits.  As a
       result of this, the "raindrops"[1] gem/library is now a required
       dependency.
       
       TCP socket defaults now favor low latency to mimic UNIX domain
       socket behavior (tcp_nodelay: true, tcp_nopush: false).  This
       hurts throughput, users who want to favor throughput should
       specify "tcp_nodelay: false, tcp_nopush: true" in the listen
       directive.
       
       Error logging is more consistent and all lines should be
       formatted correctly in backtraces.  This may break the
       behavior of some log parsers.
       
       The call stack is smaller and thus easier to examine backtraces
       when debugging Rack applications.
       
       There are some internal API changes and cleanups, but none that
       affect applications designed for Rack.  See "git log v3.7.0.."
       for details.
       
       For users who cannot install kgio[2] or raindrops, Unicorn 1.1.x
       remains supported indefinitely.  Unicorn 3.x will remain
       supported if there is demand.  We expect raindrops to introduce
       fewer portability problems than kgio did, however.

       slightly faster worker process spawning
       
       It's still O(n) since we don't maintain a reverse mapping of
       spawned processes, but at least we avoid the extra overhead of
       creating an array every time.

       reenable heartbeat checking for idle workers
       
       Some applications/libraries may launch background threads which
       can lock up the process.  So we can't disable heartbeat checking
       just because the main thread is sleeping.  This also has the
       side effect of reducing master process wakeups when all workers
       are idle.

       We don't want the Worker#tick= assignment to trigger after we
       accept a client, since we'd drop that request when we raise the
       exception that breaks us out of the worker loop.
       
       Also, we don't want to enter IO.select with an empty LISTENERS
       array so we can fail with IOError or Errno::EBADF.

       test_http_parser: fix for URI too long errors (#3)
       
       The random garbage generator may occasionally generate URIs that
       are too long and cause the URI-specific error to be raised
       instead of the generic parser error we recently introduced.

       error logging is more consistent
       
       Backtraces are now formatted properly (with timestamps) and
       exceptions will be logged more consistently and similar to
       Logger defaults:
       
         "#{exc.message} (#{e.class})"
         backtrace.each { |line| ... }
       
       This may break some existing monitoring scripts, but errors
       will be more standardized and easier to check moving forward.

       rescuing from SystemExit and exit()-ing again is ugly, but
       changes made to lower stack depth positively affect _everyone_
       so we'll tolerate some ugliness here.
       
       We'll need to disable graceful exit for some tests, too...

       higher file descriptor limit for systems running >= 1024
       workers.

       unicorn 3.6.2 - fix Unicorn::OobGC module
       
       The optional Unicorn::OobGC module is reimplemented to fix
       breakage that appeared in v3.3.1.  There are also minor
       documentation updates, but no code changes as of 3.6.1 for
       non-OobGC users.
       
       There is also a v1.1.7 release to fix the same OobGC breakage
       that appeared for 1.1.x users in the v1.1.6 release.

       unicorn 1.1.7 - major fixes to minor components
       
       No changes to the core code, so this release only affects users
       of the Unicorn::OobGC and Unicorn::ExecCGI modules.
       Unicorn::OobGC was totally broken by the fix in the v1.1.6
       release and is now reimplemented.  Unicorn::ExecCGI (which
       hardly anybody uses) now returns proper HTTP status codes.

       oob_gc: reimplement to fix breakage and add tests
       
       This was broken since v3.3.1[1] and v1.1.6[2] since nginx relies on
       a closed socket (and not Content-Length/Transfer-Encoding) to
       detect a response completion.  We have to close the client
       socket before invoking GC to ensure the client sees the response
       in a timely manner.

       These options will probably be more important as interest in
       streaming responses in Rails 3.1 develops.
       
       I consider the respective defaults for Unicorn (designed to run
       behind nginx) and Rainbows! (designed to run standalone) to be
       the best choices in their respective environments.

       examples/nginx.conf: clarify proxy_buffering for Rails 3.1
       
       I've tested with nginx 1.0.0 and confirmed "proxy_buffering off;"
       can cause Unicorn to block on a slow client reading a
       large response.  While there's a potential (client-visible)
       performance improvement with Rails 3.1 streaming responses, it
       can also hurt the server with slow clients.
       
       Rainbows! with (ThreadSpawn or ThreadPool) is probably the best
       way to do streaming responses efficiently from all angles (from
       a server, client and programmer time perspective).

       unicorn 3.6.1 - fix OpenSSL PRNG workaround
       
       Our attempt in 3.6.0 to workaround a problem with the OpenSSL
       PRNG actually made the problem worse.  This release corrects the
       workaround to properly reseed the OpenSSL PRNG after forking.

       to actually get a random value to seed the OpenSSL PRNG.

       unicorn 3.6.0 - small fixes, PRNG workarounds
       
       Mainly small fixes, improvements, and workarounds for fork() issues
       with pseudo-random number generators shipped with Ruby (Kernel#rand,
       OpenSSL::Random (used by SecureRandom and also by Rails).
       
       The PRNG issues are documented in depth here (and links to Ruby Redmine):
       
         http://bogomips.org/unicorn.git/commit?id=1107ede7
         http://bogomips.org/unicorn.git/commit?id=b3241621
       
       If you're too lazy to upgrade, you can just do this in your after_fork
       hooks:
       
         after_fork do |server,worker|
           tmp = srand
           OpenSSL::Random.seed(tmp.to_s) if defined?(OpenSSL::Random)
         end
       
       There are also small log reopening (SIGUSR1) improvements:
       
       * relative paths may also be reopened, there's a small chance this
         will break with a handful of setups, but unlikely.  This should
         make configuration easier especially since the "working_directory"
         configurator directive exists.  Brought up by Matthew Kocher:
         http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.ruby.unicorn.general/900
       
       * workers will just die (and restart) if log reopening fails for
         any reason (including user error).  This is to workaround the issue
         reported by Emmanuel Gomez:

       NOT intended to be an API.

       reseed OpenSSL PRNG upon fork() of workers
       
       OpenSSL seeds its PRNG with the process ID, so if a process ID
       is recycled, there's a chance of indepedent workers getting
       repeated PRNG sequences over a long time period iff the same
       PID is used.
       
       This only affects deployments that meet both of the following
       conditions:
       
       1) OpenSSL::Random.random_bytes is called before forking
       2) worker (but not master) processes are die unexpectedly
       
       The SecureRandom module in Ruby (and Rails) uses the OpenSSL
       PRNG if available.  SecureRandom is used by Rails and called
       when the application is loaded, so most Rails apps with
       frequently dying worker processes are affected.
       
       Of course dying worker processes are bad and entirely the
       fault of bad application/library code, not the fault of
       Unicorn.
       
       Thanks for Alexander Dymo for reporting this.

       The current versions of Ruby 1.8 do not reseed the PRNG after
       forking, so we'll work around that by calling Kernel#srand.

       unicorn 3.5.0 - very minor improvements
       
       A small set of small changes but it's been more than a month
       since our last release.  There are minor memory usage and
       efficiently improvements (for graceful shutdowns).  MRI 1.8.7
       users on *BSD should be sure they're using the latest patchlevel
       (or upgrade to 1.9.x) because we no longer workaround their
       broken stdio (that's MRI's job :)

       unicorn 3.4.0 - for people with very big LANs
       
       * IPv6 support in the HTTP hostname parser and configuration
         language.  Configurator syntax for "listen" addresses should
         be the same as nginx.  Even though we support IPv6, we will
         never support non-LAN/localhost clients connecting to Unicorn.
       
       * TCP_NOPUSH/TCP_CORK is enabled by default to optimize
         for bandwidth usage and avoid unnecessary wakeups in nginx.
       
       * Updated KNOWN_ISSUES document for bugs in recent Ruby 1.8.7
         (RNG needs reset after fork) and nginx+sendfile()+FreeBSD 8.
       
       * examples/nginx.conf updated for modern stable versions of nginx.
       
       * "Status" in headers no longer ignored in the response,
         Rack::Lint already enforces this so we don't duplicate
         the work.
       
       * All tests pass under Ruby 1.9.3dev
       
       * various bugfixes in the (mostly unused) ExecCGI class that
         powers http://bogomips.org/unicorn.git

       allow binding on IPv6 sockets with listen "[#{addr}]:#{port}"
       
       This is much like how nginx does it, except we always require a
       port when explicitly binding to IPv6 using the "listen"
       directive.  This also adds support to listen with an
       address-only, which can be useful to Rainbows! users.

       http: parser handles IPv6 bracketed IP hostnames
       
       Just in case we have people that don't use DNS, we can support
       folks who enter ugly IPv6 addresses...
       
       IPv6 uses brackets around the address to avoid confusing
       the colons used in the address with the colon used to denote
       the TCP port number in URIs.

       enable TCP_NOPUSH/TCP_CORK by default
       
       It's actually harmless since Unicorn only supports "fast"
       applications that do not trickle, and we don't do keepalive so
       we'll always flush-on-close.  This should reduce wakeups on the
       nginx proxy server if nginx is over TCP.  Mongrel 1.x had
       TCP_CORK enabled by default, too.

       the correct offset is set before hand and the file
       is unlinked.

       This can return a static string and be significantly
       faster as it reduces object allocations and Ruby method
       calls for the fastest websites that serve thousands of
       requests a second.
       
       It assumes the Ruby runtime is single-threaded, but that
       is the case of Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 and also what Unicorn
       is all about.  This change is safe for Rainbows! under 1.8
       and 1.9.

       http: support keepalive_requests directive
       
       This limits the number of keepalive requests of a single
       connection to prevent a single client from monopolizing server
       resources.  On multi-process servers (e.g. Rainbows!) with many
       keepalive clients per worker process, this can force a client to
       reconnect and increase its chances of being accepted on a
       less-busy worker process.
       
       This directive is named after the nginx directive which
       is identical in function.

       unicorn 3.1.0 - client_buffer_body_size tuning
       
       This release enables tuning the client_buffer_body_size to raise
       or lower the threshold for buffering request bodies to disk.
       This only applies to users who have not disabled rewindable
       input.  There is also a TeeInput bugfix for uncommon usage
       patterns and Configurator examples in the FAQ should be fixed

       tee_input: fix accounting error on corked requests
       
       In case a request sends the header and buffer as one packet,
       TeeInput relying on accounting info from StreamInput is harmful
       as StreamInput will buffer in memory outside of TeeInput's
       control.
       
       This bug is triggered by calling env["rack.input"].size or
       env["rack.input"].rewind before to read.

       unicorn 3.0.0 - disable rewindable input!
       
       Rewindable "rack.input" may be disabled via the
       "rewindable_input false" directive in the configuration file.
       This will violate Rack::Lint for Rack 1.x applications, but can
       reduce I/O for applications that do not need a rewindable
       input.
       
       This release updates us to the Kgio 2.x series which should play
       more nicely with other libraries and applications.  There are
       also internal cleanups and improvements for future versions of
       Rainbows!

       stream_input: use String#sub! instead of gsub!
       
       There's no difference because of the \A anchor, but sub!
       is doesn't loop so it's simpler.

       stream_input: small cleanups and fixes
       
       No need to accept any number of args, that could hide bugs in
       applications that could give three or more arguments.  We also
       raise ArgumentError when given a negative length argument to
       read.

       unicorn 3.0.0pre2 - less bad than 2.x or 3.0.0pre1!
       
       This release updates us to the Kgio 2.x series which should play
       more nicely with other applications.  There are also bugfixes
       from the 2.0.1 release and a small bugfix to the new StreamInput
       class.
       
       The Unicorn 3.x series will supercede the 2.x series
       while the 1.x series will remain supported indefinitely.

       update to kgio 2.x series
       
       The Kgio 2.x API is less brain-damaged than the 1.3.x series
       was, and should solve API-compatibility problems with
       dalli 0.11.1.

       Any calls to read with an explicit zero length now returns an
       empty string.  While not explicitly specified by Rack::Lint,
       this is for compatibility with StringIO and IO methods which
       are common in other web servers.

       This will violate Rack::Lint for Rack 1.x applications, but

       configurator: enable "rewindable_input" directive
       
       This allows users to override the current Rack spec and disable
       the rewindable input requirement.  This can allow applications
       to use less I/O to minimize the performance impact when
       processing uploads.

       add stream_input class and build tee_input on it
       
       We will eventually expose a Unicorn::StreamInput object as
       "rack.input" for Rack 2.x applications.  StreamInput allows
       applications to avoid buffering input to disk, removing the
       (potentially expensive) rewindability requirement of Rack 1.x.
       
       TeeInput is also rewritten to build off StreamInput for
       simplicity.  The only regression is that TeeInput#rewind forces
       us to consume an unconsumed stream before returning, a
       negligible price to pay for decreased complexity.

       unicorn 2.0.0 - mostly internal cleanups
       
       Despite the version number, this release mostly features
       internal cleanups for future versions of Rainbows!.  User
       visible changes include reductions in CPU wakeups on idle sites
       using high timeouts.
       
       Barring possible portability issues due to the introduction of
       the kgio library, this release should be ready for all to use.
       However, 1.1.x (and possibly 1.0.x) will continue to be
       maintained.  Unicorn 1.1.5 and 1.0.2 have also been released
       with bugfixes found during development of 2.0.0.

       configurator: reloading with unset values restores default
       
       If a configuration directive is set at startup and later
       unset, it correctly restores the original default value
       as if it had never been set in the first place.
       
       This applies to the majority of the configuration values with
       a few exceptions:
       
       * This only applies to stderr_path and stdout_path when
         daemonized (the usual case, they'll be redirected to
         "/dev/null").  When NOT daemonized, we cannot easily redirect
         back to the original stdout/stderr destinations.
       
       * Unsetting working_directory does not restore the
         original working directory where Unicorn was started.
         As far as we can tell unsetting this after setting it is

       configurator: reloading with unset values restores default
       
       If a configuration directive is set at startup and later
       unset, it correctly restores the original default value
       as if it had never been set in the first place.
       
       This applies to the majority of the configuration values with
       a few exceptions:
       
       * This only applies to stderr_path and stdout_path when
         daemonized (the usual case, they'll be redirected to
         "/dev/null").  When NOT daemonized, we cannot easily redirect
         back to the original stdout/stderr destinations.
       
       * Unsetting working_directory does not restore the
         original working directory where Unicorn was started.
         As far as we can tell unsetting this after setting it is
         rarely desirable and greatly increases the probability of
         user error.

       master: remove limit on queued signals
       
       If a moronic sysadmin is sending too many signals, just let them
       do it.  It's likely something is terribly wrong when the server
       is overloaded with signals, so don't try to protect users from
       it.  This will also help in case where TTOU signals are sent too
       quickly during shutdown, although sleeping between kill(2)
       syscalls is always a good idea because of how non-real-time
       signals are delivered.

       unicorn 2.0.0pre3 - more small fixes
       
       There is a new Unicorn::PrereadInput middleware to which allows
       input bodies to be drained off the socket and buffered to disk
       (or memory) before dispatching the application.
       
       HTTP Pipelining behavior is fixed for Rainbows!  There
       are some small Kgio fixes and updates for Rainbows!
       users as well.

       with Rainbows!...

       avoid unlinking actively listening sockets
       
       While we've always unlinked dead sockets from nuked/leftover
       processes, blindly unlinking them can cause unnecessary failures
       when an active process is already listening on them.  We now
       make a simple connect(2) check to ensure the socket is not in
       use before unlinking it.
       
       Thanks to Jordan Ritter for the detailed bug report leading to
       this fix.

       TUNING: more on socket buffer sizes
       
       Large buffers can hurt as well as help.  And the difference
       in real apps that do a lot of things other than I/O often
       makes it not worth it.

       If multithreaded programming can be compared to juggling
       chainsaws, then multithreaded programming with signal handlers
       in play is akin to juggling chainsaws on a tightrope
       over shark-infested waters.

       IOError may occur due to race conditions as another thread

       to check.
       
       Errno::EBADF may occur in some applications that close a file

       the same descriptor, possibly one of them using IO#for_fd).

       SIGHUP deals w/ dual master pid path scenario
       
       As described in our SIGNALS documentation, sending SIGHUP to the
       old master (to respawn SIGWINCH-ed children) while the new
       master (spawned from SIGUSR2) is active is useful for backing
       out of an upgrade before sending SIGQUIT to the new master.
       
       Unfortunately, the SIGHUP signal to the old master will cause
       the ".oldbin" pid file to be reset to the non-".oldbin" version
       and thus attempt to clobber the pid file in use by the
       to-be-terminated new master process.
       
       Thanks to the previous commit to prevent redaemonization in the
       new master, the old master can reliably detect if the new master
       is active while it is reloading the config file.
       
       Thanks to Lawrence Pit for discovering this bug.

       launcher: do not re-daemonize when USR2 upgrading
       
       This was accidentally enabled when ready_pipe was developed.
       While re-daemonizing appears harmless in most cases this makes
       detecting backed-out upgrades from the original master process
       impossible.

       tee_input: safer record separator ($/) handling
       
       Different threads may change $/ during execution, so cache it at
       function entry to a local variable for safety.  $/ may also be
       of a non-binary encoding, so rely on Rack::Utils.bytesize to
       portably capture the correct size.
       
       Our string slicing is always safe from 1.9 encoding: both our
       socket and backing temporary file are opened in binary mode,
       so we'll always be dealing with binary strings in this class
       (in accordance to the Rack spec).

       socket_helper: tunables for tcp_defer_accept/accept_filter
       
       Under Linux, this allows users to tune the time (in seconds) to
       defer connections before allowing them to be accepted.  The
       behavior of TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT changed with Linux 2.6.32 and idle
       connections may still be accept()-ed after the specified value
       in seconds.  A small value of '1' remains the default for
       Unicorn as Unicorn does not worry about slow clients.  Higher
       values provide better DoS protection for Rainbows! but also
       increases kernel memory usage.
       
       Allowing "dataready" for FreeBSD accept filters will allow
       SSL sockets to be used in the future for HTTPS, too.

       module, it makes documentation noisier.
