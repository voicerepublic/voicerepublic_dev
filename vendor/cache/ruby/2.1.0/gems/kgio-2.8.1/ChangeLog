       kgio 2.8.1 - minor improvements and test fixes
       
       Improved error reporting for kgio_accept/kgio_tryaccept.
       Minor size reduction throughout.  There are also several
       test case fixes for race conditions.
       
       Thanks to Hleb Valoshka and the Debian project for all the
       help with this release!

       Close tempfile and unlink it immediately.
       
       When a Tempfile object is garbage collected, or when the Ruby interpreter
       exits, its associated temporary file is automatically deleted. This may
       lead to race condition when Tempfile is used like in these tests.

       Just spam the thread several times to force the wakeup to happen
       and not be as dependent on signal handler execution ordering of
       different Ruby VMs.

       test_poll: avoid potentially thread-unsafe test
       
       Modifying pollset in a different pollset is thread-unsafe,
       so just do that inside the signal handler as that should
       fire before restarting poll().

       test/lib_read_write: account for larger-than-normal pipes
       
       Linux pipe buffers may use larger pages and increase the
       capacity of pipes.  Thus the 10000 write attempt is not
       sufficient; just infinite loop until we hit :wait_writable.

       test_tryopen: skip EACCES test when euid == 0
       
       This fails when the test is run as root (which may be the case
       of some Ruby installations) or fakeroot (which is the case of
       Debian build systems).

       Change prefix of temporary sockets to prevent races
       
       Note: this is an incomplete fix and the race can still happen.
       A proper fix would involve using a temporary directory for each
       test and placing the Unix socket in there.

       TCP Fast Open in Linux 3.7 and later is now supported
       in the client via Kgio::Socket#kgio_fastopen.
       
       This release also adds the kgio_writev and
       kgio_trywritev methods, thanks to funny-falcon

       accept: do not set blocking if non-blocking is set
       
       This is prone to race conditions in multiprocess situations
       where one process is relying on non-blocking operation while
       another (likely newer process) relies on blocking operation.
       
       Since the blocking process can always fall back to calling
       rb_io_wait_readable(), use that instead and give up some
       scalability for higher reliability.
       
       Those interested in avoiding thundering herds will have to
       stop/start their processes using blocking sockets (and tolerate
       some downtime).

       implement TCP Fast Open support (client + server)
       
       Server support just requires exposing one constant for
       setsockopt: Kgio::TCP_FASTOPEN
       
       Client support implements a new Kgio::Socket#fastopen method.
       This new method wraps the the sendto() syscall.  With TCP Fast
       Open, the sendto() syscall is overloaded for stream sockets to
       implement the functionality of both connect() + write()
       
       Since it only makes sense to use _blocking_ I/O for sendto(),
       TFO clients are only supported in Ruby implementations with
       native threads.

       Kgio::Socket.new retains compatibility with Socket.new
       
       This allows us to create an unconnected socket, just like

       usable.

       test workaround for platforms with unreliable signals
       
       Ruby may not respond well to signals on all platforms, especially not
       after fork()-ing in the face of a running pthread (timer thread on
       1.9.2).  SIGKILL bypasses Ruby (and all userspace) signal handling on
       Debian GNU/kFreeBSD.

       add `#kgio_writev` and `#kgio_trywritev`
       
       Add methods for using writev(2) syscall for sending array of string in
       a single syscall. This is more efficient than concatenating strings on
       Ruby side or sending them one by one.
       `#kgio_trywritev` returns array of strings which are not sent to the
       socket. If there were objects other than string, they could be converted
       using `#to_s` method, but this is not strictly applied, cause
       `#kgio_*writev` tries to write at most `sysconf(_SC_IOV_MAX)` items
       at once (for Linux its value is 1024). First string of returned array
       could be part of string from array, so that you should assume it is not
       in consistent state.
       
       `#kgio_writev` semantic differs a bit from `#kgio_write` in term of
       buffers mutability: currently `#kgio_write` tries to follow string changes
       made concurrently, but `#kgio_writev` works with array's lightweight copy.

       test/lib_read_write: test workarounds for TCP in FreeBSD 9.0
       
       Under load, TCP sockets may not register as readable right away
       after the writer finishes.  This can be expected for
       implementations where loopback TCP is a closer simulation of
       non-local TCP traffic.
       
       These test failures were noticed under FreeBSD 9.0.

       We don't need to care for TCP_NOPUSH in read_write.c, it's
       entirely in autopush.c and no-op on platforms without
       TCP_CORK/TCP_NOPUSH.  TCP_CORK/TCP_NOPUSH are non-POSIX, so
       it's entirely possible some Free systems will lack them.

       always been broken outside of Linux-based systems,
       as we never marked the socket as having pending data.

       kgio 2.7.0 - minor updates
       
       When running under Ruby trunk/2.0.0dev, all IO objects created
       by kgio will be close-on-exec by default to match the (future)
       2.0.0 behavior.  accept()ed sockets in kgio have always been
       close-on-exec by default..
       
       Singleton Kgio.accept_* methods are deprecated as the
       kgio_accept/kgio_tryaccept methods all take an additional
       flags argument.
       
       There are various, test, documentation, and error message
       improvements.

       doc: update documentation regarding accept method flags
       
       There's no reason for SOCK_NONBLOCK with Ruby, and SOCK_CLOEXEC
       has always been on-by-default with accept() wrappers.

       connect,tryopen: set close-on-exec flag for new fds on Ruby 2.0+
       
       All IO objects created by Kgio will have FD_CLOEXEC descriptor
       flag set on it when run under Ruby 2.0.0dev.  This matches the
       upcoming behavior of Ruby 2.0.0dev for IO objects in the core
       and standard library.  This change does not affect users on Ruby
       1.9.3 and earlier.
       
       accept()-ed sockets in kgio have _always_ had FD_CLOEXEC
       set by default.

       tests: remove tests for IO#nonblock? after accept
       
       There's no point in testing a Ruby implementation detail and
       these tests fail under OpenBSD where the accept()-ed socket
       inherits the O_NONBLOCK flag from the parent.

       accept: deprecate singleton Kgio.accept_* methods
       
       The kgio_accept and kgio_tryaccept methods now take an
       additional flags argument, so there's no reason to set
       global flags anywhere.

       accept: always set O_NONBLOCK for accept()-ed sockets in 1.8
       
       This is mostly an implementation detail, but it's already
       true on OpenBSD (and maybe other BSDs), and also requires
       no additional syscalls on newer Linux systems.

       It's more reliable than relying on IO::NONBLOCK and

       guaranteed to be equivalent to what accept4() takes even
       though the current Linux implementation does it this way.

       make timed kgio_wait_* implementation safer
       
       IO.select can handle fd >= 1024 safely in some Rubies while
       fd_set may not.  We could use rb_thread_fd_select(), but
       rb_wait_for_single_fd() is available now so the former
       is not worth the maintenance hassle.

       for certain descriptors.
       
       This method uses the new rb_wait_for_single_fd() function in
       Ruby 1.9.r.  This internally uses ppoll() under Linux, meaning
       it performs the same regardless of the FD used.

       kgio 2.4.1 - Kgio.poll avoids EINTR, really
       
       This release fixes a race condition that could allow
       Errno::EINTR to be raised even though the 2.4.0 release
       was supposed to stop that.
       
       Nobody uses Kgio.poll, really, so this shouldn't be an issue
       for real code, yet.

       This will allow users to subclass Kgio::File and
       override certain behavior (e.g. overriding "#each").

       return Kgio::File for Kgio.tryopen
       
       This also allows us to return/override #to_path and #path if
       necessary, but so far everything works with MRI 1.8, MRI 1.9,
       and Rubinius.

   Date:   Fri May 13 15:55:50 2011 -0700
   
       add Kgio.tryopen method
       
       For the case where a file is readable, it's faster to
       just call open() instead of stat()-ing and then calling
       open().
       
       open() failures are still relatively cheap, too, they're still
       more expensive than a failed stat() but cheaper than raising
       an exception.

       * OpenBSD (and possibly other *BSD) fixes, thanks to Jeremy Evans.
       
       * kgio_accept and kgio_tryaccept now take an optional second argument
         for flags (like the accept4() flags argument).
       
       == Ruby 1.9-only things
       
       * Kgio.poll no longer raises Errno::EINTR to match IO.select.
       
       == Ruby 1.9 trunk things
       
       * close() on an active FD in a different thread is better
         handled/detected.
       
       * copy-on-write for strings is properly triggered

       poll: deal with pollset changes on EINTR
       
       This allows callers to modify the pollset, interrupt
       the polling thread, and then poll with the modified
       pollset.  This is also important for dealing with
       closed IO objects that may have been invalidated
       due to GC, too.

       kgio 2.3.0 - MSG_PEEK and poll(2) support
       
       recv() with MSG_PEEK for sockets is added with the try*
       interface.  SocketMethods#kgio_trypeek and
       SocketMethods#kgio_peek or Kgio.trypeek for non-Kgio-enabled
       sockets.
       
       For Ruby 1.9 only: poll(2) is exposed via the Kgio.poll
       singleton method and should provide an alternative for IO.select
       users.
       
       Both of these new features should work well on modern Unix-like
       operating systems.

       It's a nice alternative to IO.select for higher-numbered
       file descriptors, especially sparse ones.  Our interface
       also generates less garbage than IO.select does.

       add support for recv() with MSG_PEEK
       
       Kgio.trypeek, kgio_trypeek and kgio_peek methods are added
       for using with sockets.

       kgio 2.2.0 - kinder, gentler I/O for the Internets
       
       * sockets accept()ed by a TCP_NOPUSH/TCP_CORK listener
         automatically flush on kgio_*read calls if there is pending
         data.  "Kgio.autopush = false" disables this globally,
         and Kgio::Socket also get "kgio_autopush=" to enable/disable
         on a per-object individual basis.
       
       * ECONNRESET exceptions get empty backtraces for kgio_*read.
         There's nothing a programmer can do about these, so there's
         no point in going through the expensive backtrace generation
         process.
       
       * Kgio.try* singleton methods added for working with non-Kgio
         enhanced objects.  No more needing to use Object#extend
         and blowing away your method cache to make existing I/O
         objects kinder and gentler.
       
       * IPv6 support should be complete, systems without a native
         getaddrinfo(3) are now unsupported (and will remain so
         unless somebody complains).
       
       There should be no other backwards-incompatible changes other
       than requiring getaddrinfo(3) and friends for IPv6 support.

       autopush: optimize away ivar usage under MRI
       
       We know that all versions of MRI have a small RFile structure
       that is allocated in the same object slots as other Ruby types
       and also zeroed on allocation.
       
       This optimization enables us to fall back to using ivars in
       case MRI changes or if we're used on other Rubies.

       preliminary implementation of "smart_nopush"
       
       It only supports TCP_CORK under Linux right now.
       
       We use a very basic strategy to use TCP_CORK semantics optimally
       in most TCP servers:  On corked sockets, we will uncork on recv()
       if there was a previous send().  Otherwise we do not fiddle
       with TCP_CORK at all.
       
       Under Linux, we can rely on TCP_CORK being inherited in an
       accept()-ed client socket so we can avoid syscalls for each
       accept()-ed client if we already know the accept() socket corks.
       
       This module does NOTHING for client TCP sockets, we only deal
       with accept()-ed sockets right now.

       kgio_read and kgio_tryread will now return an empty string when

       IO#sysread, IO#read_nonblock in core Ruby for consistency.

       kgio 1.2.1 - doc and *BSD workarounds
       
       This fixes our accept4() wrapper which did not work as expected
       on some *BSD-based systems due to fcntl(fd, F_GETFL) returning
       false information.  Linux 2.6+ users are unnaffected, including
       those without accept4().
       
       Also some RDoc fixes.

       This is totally broken on the part of the OS.

       kgio 1.2.0 - cleanups and minor improvements
       
       The C extension is now split into several files for
       ease-of-maintenance.
       
       Slightly more common, client-triggerable exceptions (EOFError,
       Errno::EPIPE, Errno::ECONNRESET) are now less expensive as they
       are generated without backtraces.

       generate empty backtraces for EPIPE and ECONNRESET
       
       Malicious clients may disconnect during big writes to cause
       EPIPE and ECONNRESET exceptions.  Generating backtraces can be
       expensive with Ruby, so mitigate the DoS vector by lowering the
       cost of generating an exception.

       Except EOFError is gently raised to not include a huge

       busy servers that malicious clients may exploit to deny service.

       Make kgio_trywrite more aggressive with retrying
       
       Partial writes can be retried until completely denied with
       EAGAIN.  Often times, it is beneficial to retry immediately
       after a partial write because the kernel may allocate more
       buffers or the reader can drain the buffers.
       
       This helps the caller avoid crossing the Ruby <-> C boundary
       more than necessary.

       We'll stick with the "try" prefix if we're going to be
       non-blocking.  kgio_accept will favor a blocking accept() call
       where it's possible to release the GVL, allowing it to avoid
       thundering herd problems.  Otherwise it'll use thread-safe
       blocking under Ruby 1.8.
